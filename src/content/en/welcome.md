## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a free and open-source component-based front-end software framework,[2] and language[3] created by Rich Harris and maintained by the Svelte core team members.[4]

Svelte is not a monolithic JavaScript library imported by applications: instead, Svelte compiles HTML templates to specialized code that manipulates the DOM directly, which may reduce the size of transferred files and give better client performance.[5] Application code is also processed by the compiler, inserting calls to automatically recompute data[2] and re-render UI elements when the data they depend on is modified.[6] This also avoids the overhead associated with runtime intermediate representations, such as virtual DOM,[7] unlike traditional frameworks (such as React and Vue) which carry out the bulk of their work at runtime, i.e. in the browser.[5][6][4][8][2][7]

The compiler itself is written in JavaScript.[9][8] Its source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on GitHub.[8] Among comparable frontend libraries, Svelte has one of the smallest bundle footprint at merely 2KB.[10]
