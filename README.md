# sveltekit-inlang-paraglide-demo

Simple multilanguage demo with SvelteKit and [@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-sveltekit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-sveltekit).

Features:

- conditional markdown loading based on selected language (server side)
- translated URL slugs

🚧 Quick demo and my first try, needs some improvements (e.g. type safety) 🚧

## Local setup

```
npm i
npm run dev -- -- open
```
